# Project Description

This project undertakes carbon analtyics through the assessment of carbon emission at household and regional level. 
Three main areas are covered as follows

1. Descriptive and inference statistical analysis of carbon emission for various groups
2. Carbon emission prediction by implementing various machine learning models and techniques
3. Developing a web application that allows user defined analytics and carbon emission prediction
